## Abstract

### Background

Decisions to admit high-risk postoperative patients to critical care may be affected by resource availability. We aimed to quantify adult Intensive Care/High Dependency Unit (ICU/HDU) capacity in hospitals from UK, Australia and New Zealand (NZ), and to identify and describe additional "high-acuity" beds capable of managing high-risk patients outside the ICU/HDU environment.

### Methods

We used a modified Delphi consensus method to design a survey which was disseminated via investigator networks in the UK, Australia and NZ. Hospital- and ward-level data were collected, including: bed numbers; tertiary services offered; presence of an emergency department; ward staffing levels and the availability of critical care facilities.

### Results

We received responses from `r nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "UK"))` UK (response rate `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(countryAgg == "UK"))/263 * 100`%), `r nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "Aus"))` Australian (response rate `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country %in% c("Aus")))/107 * 100`%), and `r nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "NZ"))` NZ (response rate `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country %in% c("N.Z.")))/18 * 100`%) hospitals (total `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site)`). `r sum(Org_Survey_Data_Site$icu | Org_Survey_Data_Site$hdu) / nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site) * 100`% of hospitals reported having on-site ICU and/or HDU facilities. UK hospitals reported fewer critical care beds per 100 hospital beds (median=`r median((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country %in% c("England", "Scotland", "Wales", "N.I.")))$ccuRatio, na.rm = TRUE)`) compared to Australia (median=`r median((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country == "Aus"))$ccuRatio, na.rm = TRUE)`) and NZ (median=`r median((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country == "N.Z."))$ccuRatio, na.rm = TRUE)`). `r (unique(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced$hospitalName) %>% length())/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site) * 100`% of hospitals reported having high-acuity beds which admitted high-risk patients for postoperative management, in addition to standard ICU/HDU facilities. The estimated number of critical care beds per 100,000 population was `r filter(per_capita_ccu, countryAgg == "UK")$ccuPerCapita`, `r filter(per_capita_ccu, countryAgg == "Aus")$ccuPerCapita` and `r filter(per_capita_ccu, countryAgg == "NZ")$ccuPerCapita` in the UK, Australia and NZ respectively. Per capita high-acuity bed capacity was estimated  (UK=`r filter(per_capita_ccu, countryAgg == "UK")$ccuEnhancePerCapita`, Australia=`r filter(per_capita_ccu, countryAgg == "Aus")$ccuEnhancePerCapita` and NZ=`r filter(per_capita_ccu, countryAgg == "NZ")$ccuEnhancePerCapita` beds per 100,000 population).

### Conclusions

Postoperative critical care resources differ in the UK, Australia and NZ. We have, for the first time, described high-acuity beds which may have developed to augment the capacity to deliver postoperative critical care.

## Introduction

Surgery is common and will become increasingly prevalent as populations grow and age.[@rose_estimated_2015; @the_royal_college_of_anaesthetists_perioperative_2015] Globally, the volume of surgery has been estimated at around 313 million cases a year, with high-income countries conducting procedures at a mean rate of 11,168 per 100,000 population per year.[@weiser_estimate_2015] While surgery is a treatment for disease, complications from surgery are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.[@khuri_determinants_2005; @moonesinghe_survival_2014] Critical care or protocolised pathways delivered in enhanced care areas are thought to mitigate against the risks of surgery, via the higher nurse-to-patient ratio, medical input from specialist intensivists, and availability of specific organ support therapies.[@swart_using_2017; @eichenberger_clinical_2011] As the global burden of surgery increases, the numbers of patients at risk of perioperative complications rises correspondingly. Therefore, the capacity to prospectively admit high-risk patients to critical care following surgery becomes an increasing population concern. 

In Australia and New Zealand (NZ), there are currently no national guidelines for risk stratifying postoperative critical care admissions. However, in the UK, the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) recommends critical care admission when the preoperative estimated risk of mortality is &ge;5%, while the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the Department of Health recommend that those with mortality risks &ge;10% should be admitted.[@findlay_knowing_2011; @anderson_higher_2011]

However, despite these guidelines, multiple observational studies report that critical care resources are not reliably allocated to patients at highest risk of death.[@pearse_identification_2006; @pearse_mortality_2012; @the_international_surgical_outcomes_study_group_global_2016] In some countries, a lack of critical care capacity is thought to contribute to this phenomenon.[@adhikari_critical_2010] Recent commentary suggests that alternative facilities are consequently being used to provide enhanced care to patients outside of the traditional Intensive Care and High Dependency Units (ICU/HDUs) in some hospitals in the UK.[@batchelor_critical_2017] These "high-acuity" beds may be able to provide a subset of the interventions and monitoring capabilities usually associated with critical care, and provide the necessary environment to manage the postoperative recovery of high-risk surgical patients.

We therefore performed a survey to assess the available postoperative facilities for high-risk patients in UK, Australian and NZ hospitals as part of the Second Sprint National Anaesthesia Project: EPIdemiology of Critical Care provision after Surgery (SNAP-2: EPICCS) study, an international observational cohort study investigating uncertainties around postoperative critical care.[@moonesinghe_snap-2_2017] The aim of this survey was to describe and compare the critical care, enhanced care and usual ward care availability for surgical patients in each of these countries, according to hospital types and health systems. We also aimed to investigate the hospital factors associated with critical care bed capacity, and with the likelihood of high-acuity bed availability at each site.

<!--## Prior presentation of data

A subset of the data used in this paper has previously been presented at the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland Winter Scientific Meeting, London, UK, 9&ndash;11 January 2018.[@wong_postoperative_2018] -->

## Methods

We performed a survey in all hospital sites which expressed an interest in participating in SNAP-2: EPICCS in the UK, Australia and NZ.[@moonesinghe_snap-2_2017] In the UK, sites were identified from a list of National Health Service (NHS) hospitals which undertake adult inpatient surgery, and from the list of hospitals which participated in the First Sprint National Anaesthesia Project (SNAP-1).[@walker_patient_2016; @nhs_england_cancelled_2018; @nhs_scotland_organisations_2017; @nhs_wales_nhs_2006] UK Sites were then invited to participate via approaches to the lead collaborators from SNAP-1, and the Royal College of Anaesthetists' (RCoA) network of Quality Audit and Research Coordinators (QuARCs). The QuARCs are a comprehensive network of researchers covering almost all UK NHS hospital trusts and have previously been instrumental in delivering the RCoA’s National Audit Projects.[@the_national_institute_of_academic_anaesthesia_quality_2018; @the_national_institute_of_academic_anaesthesia_national_2018] In Australia, all public hospitals accredited by Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) to provide postgraduate anaesthesia training were invited to participate. The Australian Society of Anaesthetists (ASA) state representatives, and ANZCA Clinical Trials Network (ANZCA CTN) contacted anaesthetic departments and anaesthetic department research leads via their respective national networks. In NZ, the Supportive Anaesthesia Trainee aUdit & Research Network for NZ (SATURN) approached all public hospitals accredited by ANZCA based on NZ government Ministry of Health (MoH) listings of all public hospitals providing adult inpatient surgical services. Ethical approval was not necessary, as no patient level data were collected.

The survey was conducted between 01 December 2016 and 31 March 2017 in the UK, and between 01 December 2016 and 31 January 2018 in Australia and NZ. Lead collaborators at each site were asked to answer survey questions based on their own knowledge of their hospitals' structures and processes, and to approach senior hospital and nursing management teams for additional support to obtain information. Where hospital trusts and organisations operated across more than one geographical site, individual responses were requested for each location.

### Questionnaire design

The survey was developed using a modified Delphi consensus method. A study steering group was convened with representatives from the RCoA, Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FICM), Intensive Care Society, Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, Royal College of Surgeons (England), and lay representation (Supplementary Material). Draft questions were circulated among steering group members for anonymous feedback and evaluation (Round 1). The responses were collated by a facilitator at the National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia Health Services Research Centre (NIAA HSRC). The draft questions were modified based on Round 1 feedback, and these questions then used to construct a pilot questionnaire. The pilot questionnaire was re-circulated to members of the steering group, and the survey was piloted in eight participating hospitals. A second cycle of anonymous feedback was then obtained (Round 2). The final survey was then constructed based on the responses from the Round 2 (final survey questions are reported in Supplementary Material).

The survey questionnaire was designed in the UK. To facilitate international comparisons, no further changes were made to the questionnaire before it was distributed in Australia and NZ. All authors considered the terminology and definitions used in each country to be equivalent in their local contexts.

The survey was distributed electronically using online forms (FormAssembly, Veer West LLC, Bloomington, Indiana, USA) to all collaborators at sites in the UK, and electronically via e-mail to investigators at sites in Australia and NZ. To improve response rates in the UK, monthly reminders were sent to collaborators who had yet to respond, and reminder frequency was increased to weekly in the last month of the survey period. In Australia, individual ASA state representatives were given autonomy in following up on invitations to participate in the survey within their respective states, and two cycles of reminders were sent via the ANZCA CTN with a final reminder sent in January 2018. In NZ, correspondence was maintained with individual investigators at each site until data collection was completed.

The survey recorded hospital-level characteristics, including: hospital size (total number of adult inpatient beds); number of adult ICU/HDU beds; types of tertiary services delivered; the presence or absence of an emergency department; nurse:patient staffing ratios; and the presence and characteristics of high-acuity care areas, which were defined as *"any other ward areas in the hospital which receive high-risk surgical patients for enhanced perioperative care"*. 

We defined surgical beds as those which would be used for any adult patient undergoing a non-obstetric inpatient procedure in an operating theatre or radiology suite.[@moonesinghe_snap-2_2017] 

### Statistical analyses

Descriptive statistics for normally distributed continuous data are reported with means and standard deviations (SD), and for non-normally distributed data with medians and interquartile (IQR) ranges. For all analyses, a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Critical care bed ratios were calculated per 100 hospital beds for each participating site, based on the number of critical care and hospital beds reported by survey respondents. These bed numbers were then aggregated by country and combined with published Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) indicator data on per capita hospital bed numbers to obtain critical care bed ratios per 100,000 population in each country.[@organisation_for_economic_co-operation_and_development_oecd_hospital_2018] Univariate analysis was performed to compare characteristics of hospitals, critical care units and high-acuity care areas between each participating country, using appropriate statistical tests for continuous and categorical variables. Hypothesising that critical care capacity would be related to tertiary services provided, we investigated the association between critical care bed provision at each site and variables thought to influence critical care bed capacity, using negative binomial regression, as appropriate for count data. The response variable of critical care beds per 100 hospital beds was regressed against the following covariates: number of hospital beds; tertiary services offered; country where the hospital was located; whether high-acuity care beds were present within the hospital; and whether the hospital had an emergency department. Relative ratios (RR) were calculated to express the relative difference in critical care bed numbers associated with a particular variable, after adjusting for hospital size and other variables in the model. We further investigated the characteristics associated with the likelihood of hospitals having high-acuity care areas using logistic regression, the binary outcome variable of whether high-acuity care areas were present or absent was regressed against the following covariates: number of hospital beds; whether tertiary services were offered; country; the critical care:hospital bed ratio; and whether the hospital had an emergency department.

### Sensitivity analysis

Due to the lower national response rate from Australian sites compared to the UK and NZ, we compared the hospital characteristics of the respondent sites with published data of hospitals offering surgical services from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to determine if our survey sample was biased.[@australian_institute_of_health_and_welfare_myhospitals_2017] Our collected data were matched by hospital name to this external openly accessible dataset which categorised hospitals by type (Supplementary Material).

Statistical analyses were performed using `r version$version.string` (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with the following external packages enabled: `tidyverse`, `tableone`, `sjPlot`.[@wickham_tidyverse:_2017; @yoshida_tableone:_2018; @ludecke_sjplot_2018] Negative binomial and logistic regression models were constructed using the `glm` command. Code for all analyses is available on request.

## Results

### Overview

We received responses from `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site)` hospitals across the UK, Australia and NZ. 

In the UK, `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country %in% c("England", "Scotland", "Wales", "N.I.")))` hospitals responded out of the 263 invited to participate (response rate `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(countryAgg == "UK"))/263 * 100`%); these hospitals were nested within 141 English NHS Trusts, 13 Scottish NHS Boards, 6 Welsh Health Boards, and 4 Northern Irish Health and Social Care Trusts. Our sample therefore represented `r (141+13+6+4) / 173 * 100`% of NHS secondary care organisations providing adult inpatient surgical services in the UK. 

In Australia, 107 hospitals were invited to participate, with `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "Aus"))` sites responding (response rate `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country %in% c("Aus")))/107 * 100`%). In NZ, 18 hospitals were invited to participate, with `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "N.Z."))` sites responding (response rate `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country %in% c("N.Z.")))/18 * 100`%). Responding Australian hospitals were more likely to be medium to large hospitals as classified by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, which offer a wider range of specialist services than the general population of Australian hospitals (Sensitivity Analysis, Supplementary Material).

### Hospital characteristics

The median reported hospital size in our sample was `r median(Org_Survey_Data_Site$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE)` beds (IQR = `r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Site$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE, probs = 0.25)`&ndash;`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Site$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE, probs = 0.75)`, Table 1). Australian (median `r median((Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "Aus"))$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE)` beds, IQR `r quantile((Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "Aus"))$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE, probs = 0.25)`&ndash;`r quantile((Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "Aus"))$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE, probs = 0.75)` beds) and NZ (median `r median((Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "N.Z."))$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE)` beds, IQR `r quantile((Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "N.Z."))$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE, probs = 0.25)`&ndash;`r quantile((Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "N.Z."))$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE, probs = 0.75)` beds) hospitals were not significantly different in size to those in the UK (median `r median((Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country %in% c("England", "Scotland", "Wales", "N.I.")))$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE)` beds, IQR `r quantile((Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country %in% c("England", "Scotland", "Wales", "N.I.")))$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE, probs = 0.25)`&ndash;`r quantile((Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country %in% c("England", "Scotland", "Wales", "N.I.")))$hospitalBeds, na.rm = TRUE, probs = 0.75)` beds).

The majority of responding hospitals were acute hospitals with emergency departments on-site (n = `r sum(Org_Survey_Data_Site$ed == TRUE)`, `r sum(Org_Survey_Data_Site$ed == TRUE) / nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site) * 100`%). `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(!is.na(tertiaryServices)))` hospitals (`r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(!is.na(tertiaryServices)))/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site) * 100`%) provided tertiary services. However, a higher proportion of hospitals in Australia (n = `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "Aus") %>% filter(!is.na(tertiaryServices)))`, `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "Aus") %>% filter(!is.na(tertiaryServices)))/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "Aus")) * 100`%) and NZ (n = `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "N.Z.") %>% filter(!is.na(tertiaryServices)))`, `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "N.Z.") %>% filter(!is.na(tertiaryServices)))/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(country == "N.Z.")) * 100`%) in this study were tertiary institutions than those in the UK (n = `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(!(country %in% c("Aus", "N.Z."))) %>% filter(!is.na(tertiaryServices)))`, `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(!(country %in% c("Aus", "N.Z."))) %>% filter(!is.na(tertiaryServices)))/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site %>% filter(!(country %in% c("Aus", "N.Z.")))) * 100`%). A sensitivity analysis performed indicated our Australian data sample was weighted towards medium-to-large hospitals offering more specialist services (Supplementary Table 1).

### Critical care beds

Most hospitals reported having on-site ICU/HDU facilities (n = `r sum(Org_Survey_Data_Site$icu | Org_Survey_Data_Site$hdu)`, `r sum(Org_Survey_Data_Site$icu | Org_Survey_Data_Site$hdu) / nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site) * 100`%), with a median ratio of `r median(Org_Survey_Data_Site$ccuRatio, na.rm = TRUE)` (IQR `r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Site$ccuRatio, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)`&ndash;`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Site$ccuRatio, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)`) critical care beds per 100 hospital beds. `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_CCU)` separate critical care units were described within `r sum(Org_Survey_Data_Site$icu | Org_Survey_Data_Site$hdu)` hospitals across all 3 countries (Table 2). `r table(Org_Survey_Data_CCU$ccuSpecialty)["General/Mixed"]` of these units (`r table(Org_Survey_Data_CCU$ccuSpecialty)["General/Mixed"]/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_CCU) * 100`%) admitted patients from different specialties. However, `r filter(Org_Survey_Data_CCU, ccuSpecialty != "General/Mixed") %>% pull(hospitalName) %>% unique() %>% length()` hospitals (`r (filter(Org_Survey_Data_CCU, ccuSpecialty != "General/Mixed") %>% pull(hospitalName) %>% unique() %>% length())/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_CCU) * 100`%) reported having at least one specialist critical care unit, and there were `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_CCU) - table(Org_Survey_Data_CCU$ccuSpecialty)["General/Mixed"]` such specialist units identified. Among these specialist units, `r table(Org_Survey_Data_CCU$ccuAdmitOther)["TRUE"]` (`r table(Org_Survey_Data_CCU$ccuAdmitOther)["TRUE"]/sum(table(Org_Survey_Data_CCU$ccuAdmitOther)) * 100`%) would admit patients from another specialty if necessary, with the remainder restricting admissions to patients from single specialties only (e.g. cardiothoracics, or neurosurgery).

The median number of critical care beds across all units was `r median(Org_Survey_Data_CCU$ccuBeds)` (IQR `r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_CCU$ccuBeds, probs = 0.25)`&ndash;`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_CCU$ccuBeds, probs = 0.75)`). The estimated number of critical care beds and ventilated beds per capita calculated using our sample was highest in Australia (Table 3).

Hospitals offering tertiary services had `r exp(coef(model7_offset))["!is.na(tertiaryServices)TRUE"]` times (relative ratio [RR]) as many critical care beds per 100 hospital beds than those which did not offer any tertiary services (95% CI: `r exp(confint(model7_offset))["!is.na(tertiaryServices)TRUE", 1]`&ndash;`r exp(confint(model7_offset))["!is.na(tertiaryServices)TRUE", 2]`, p = `r coef(summary(model7_offset))["!is.na(tertiaryServices)TRUE", 4]`, Figure 1), after adjusting for other variables (Supplementary Table 2 for model coefficients).

The provision of cardiothoracic (RR `r exp(coef(model13))["cardiothoracicsTRUE"]`, 95% CI `r exp(confint(model13))["cardiothoracicsTRUE", 1]`&ndash;`r exp(confint(model13))["cardiothoracicsTRUE", 2]`, p = `r coef(summary(model13))["cardiothoracicsTRUE", 4]`), neurosurgery (RR `r exp(coef(model13))["neurosurgeryTRUE"]`, 95% CI `r exp(confint(model13))["neurosurgeryTRUE", 1]`&ndash;`r exp(confint(model13))["neurosurgeryTRUE", 2]`, p = `r coef(summary(model13))["neurosurgeryTRUE", 4]`) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (RR `r exp(coef(model13))["ecmoTRUE"]`, 95% CI `r exp(confint(model13))["ecmoTRUE", 1]`&ndash;`r exp(confint(model13))["ecmoTRUE", 2]`, p = `r coef(summary(model13))["ecmoTRUE", 4]`) tertiary services were associated with increased proportions of critical care beds within hospitals (Figure 2).

UK hospitals had a smaller proportion of critical care beds per 100 hospital beds (median `r median((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country %in% c("England", "Scotland", "Wales", "N.I.")))$ccuRatio, na.rm = TRUE)`, IQR `r quantile((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country %in% c("England", "Scotland", "Wales", "N.I.")))$ccuRatio, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)`&ndash;`r quantile((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country %in% c("England", "Scotland", "Wales", "N.I.")))$ccuRatio, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)`) compared to hospitals in Australia (median `r median((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country == "Aus"))$ccuRatio, na.rm = TRUE)`, IQR `r quantile((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country == "Aus"))$ccuRatio, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)`&ndash;`r quantile((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country == "Aus"))$ccuRatio, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)`) and NZ (median `r median((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country == "N.Z."))$ccuRatio, na.rm = TRUE)`, IQR `r quantile((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country == "N.Z."))$ccuRatio, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)`&ndash;`r quantile((filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, country == "N.Z."))$ccuRatio, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)`). However, after adjusting for tertiary services delivered, and hospital size, the proportion of critical care beds to total hospital beds was lower in Australia (RR `r exp(coef(model13))["countryAggAus"]`, 95% CI `r exp(confint(model13))["countryAggAus", 1]`&ndash;`r exp(confint(model13))["countryAggAus", 2]`, p = `r coef(summary(model13))["countryAggAus", 4]`) and NZ (RR `r exp(coef(model13))["countryAggNZ"]`, 95% CI `r exp(confint(model13))["countryAggNZ", 1]`&ndash;`r exp(confint(model13))["countryAggNZ", 2]`, p = `r coef(summary(model13))["countryAggNZ", 4]`) than in the UK (Supplementary Table 3 for model coefficients). Neither the presence of an emergency department, nor the presence of enhanced ward areas were associated with the proportion of critical care beds in any of the three countries.

### High-acuity care areas

`r unique(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced$hospitalName) %>% length()` (`r (unique(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced$hospitalName) %>% length())/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Site) * 100`%) hospitals reported having high-acuity care areas where high risk surgical patients could be admitted for postoperative management outside the operating theatre or critical care complexes: `r table(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "UK")$enhancedWard)["TRUE"]` hospitals in the UK (`r table(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "UK")$enhancedWard)["TRUE"]/nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "UK")) * 100`% of hospitals); `r table(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "Aus")$enhancedWard)["TRUE"]` in Australia (`r table(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "Aus")$enhancedWard)["TRUE"]/nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "Aus")) * 100`%) and `r table(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "NZ")$enhancedWard)["TRUE"]` in NZ (`r table(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "NZ")$enhancedWard)["TRUE"]/nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "NZ")) * 100`%). A total of `r nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced)` such high-acuity care areas were identified (Table 4). These areas have a median `r median(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced$enhancedWardBeds)` beds (IQR `r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced$enhancedWardBeds, prob = 0.25)`&ndash;`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced$enhancedWardBeds, prob = 0.75)` beds), and a median nurse:patient ratio of 1:`r median(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced$enhancedNurseRatio, na.rm = TRUE)` (IQR 1:`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced$enhancedNurseRatio, prob = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)`&ndash;1:`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced$enhancedNurseRatio, prob = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)`). Patient care was led by surgeons in `r nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced, enhancedWardConsult == "Surgeon"))` (`r nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced, enhancedWardConsult == "Surgeon"))/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced) * 100`%) of these high-acuity care areas.

These areas were able to deliver a heterogeneous subset of interventions normally associated with critical care (Table 4), ranging from continuous observations and monitoring (n = `r nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced, continuousObs == TRUE))`, `r nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced, continuousObs == TRUE))/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced) * 100`%), to Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) or Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP) support (n = `r nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced, NIV == TRUE))`, `r nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced, NIV == TRUE))/nrow(Org_Survey_Data_Enhanced) * 100`%).

Larger hospitals (adjusted odds ratio [OR] `r exp(coef(model12)["scale(hospitalBeds)"])` for every standard deviation increase in hospital bed numbers, 95% CI `r exp(confint(model12))["scale(hospitalBeds)", 1]`&ndash;`r exp(confint(model12))["scale(hospitalBeds)", 2]`, p = `r coef(summary(model12))["scale(hospitalBeds)", 4]`) providing tertiary services (adjusted OR `r exp(coef(model12)["!is.na(tertiaryServices)TRUE"])`, 95% CI `r exp(confint(model12))["!is.na(tertiaryServices)TRUE", 1]`&ndash;`r exp(confint(model12))["!is.na(tertiaryServices)TRUE", 2]`, p = `r coef(summary(model12))["!is.na(tertiaryServices)TRUE", 4]`) were more likely to report having high-acuity care areas. Hospitals with emergency departments (adjusted OR `r exp(coef(model12)["edTRUE"])`, 95% CI `r exp(confint(model12))["edTRUE", 1]`&ndash;`r exp(confint(model12))["edTRUE", 2]`, p = `r coef(summary(model12))["edTRUE", 4]`) were less likely to report having these types of beds. Full coefficients for our logistic regression model are available in Supplementary Table 4.

After critical care and high-acuity bed numbers were considered together, the total potential per capita capacity for delivering at least some critical care to postoperative patients increases in all three countries (Table 3).

### General surgical wards

Across all three countries, hospitals reported a median ratio of `r median((Org_Survey_Data_Site$genSurgTotalBeds / Org_Survey_Data_Site$hospitalBeds), na.rm = TRUE) * 100` surgical beds per 100 hospital beds (IQR `r quantile((Org_Survey_Data_Site$genSurgTotalBeds / Org_Survey_Data_Site$hospitalBeds * 100), na.rm = TRUE, probs = 0.25)`&ndash;`r quantile((Org_Survey_Data_Site$genSurgTotalBeds / Org_Survey_Data_Site$hospitalBeds * 100), na.rm = TRUE, probs = 0.75)`). The average surgical ward was reported as having a median `r median(Org_Survey_Data_Site$genSurgAveBeds, na.rm = TRUE)` beds (IQR `r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Site$genSurgAveBeds, prob = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)`&ndash;`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Site$genSurgAveBeds, prob = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)` beds). The median nurse:patient ratio during the day time was 1:`r median(Org_Survey_Data_Site$nurseDayRatio, na.rm = TRUE)` (IQR 1:`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Site$nurseDayRatio, prob = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)`&ndash;1:`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Site$nurseDayRatio, prob = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)`, Table 5), and this ratio dropped to a median of 1:`r median(Org_Survey_Data_Site$nurseNightRatio, na.rm = TRUE)` nurse:patients (IQR 1:`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Site$nurseNightRatio, prob = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)`&ndash;1:`r quantile(Org_Survey_Data_Site$nurseNightRatio, prob = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)`) at night. 

General surgical ward nurses in the UK were responsible for more beds per nurse than in Australia or NZ, both in the day and at night (Table 5, p <0.001). The majority of UK (n = `r table(Org_Survey_Data_Site$HCAs, Org_Survey_Data_Site$countryAgg)["TRUE", "UK"]`, `r table(Org_Survey_Data_Site$HCAs, Org_Survey_Data_Site$countryAgg)["TRUE", "UK"]/nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "UK")) * 100`%) and NZ (n = `r table(Org_Survey_Data_Site$HCAs, Org_Survey_Data_Site$countryAgg)["TRUE", "NZ"]`, `r table(Org_Survey_Data_Site$HCAs, Org_Survey_Data_Site$countryAgg)["TRUE", "NZ"]/nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "NZ")) * 100`%) hospitals reported staffing surgical wards with health care assistants to supplement the care delivered by nurses. In contrast, health care assistants were less commonly employed in Australia with only `r table(Org_Survey_Data_Site$HCAs, Org_Survey_Data_Site$countryAgg)["TRUE", "Aus"]` hospitals (`r table(Org_Survey_Data_Site$HCAs, Org_Survey_Data_Site$countryAgg)["TRUE", "Aus"]/nrow(filter(Org_Survey_Data_Site, countryAgg == "Aus")) * 100`%) reporting their deployment on surgical wards.

## Discussion

### Principal Findings

We present a comprehensive overview of postoperative critical care facilities available for patients undergoing inpatient surgery in the UK, Australia and NZ. Our study describes the critical care provision in hospitals within these countries, and quantifies the availability of high-acuity care areas where postoperative patients may receive critical care therapies outside of the traditional ICU/HDU setting. Hospitals in NZ were generally smaller compared to the UK and Australia. The proportion of hospital beds which were dedicated to critical care was similar across the three countries, however the estimated per capita critical care capacity was highest in Australia. General surgery wards in Australia and NZ reported more favourable nurse:patient staffing ratios than the UK. High-acuity care areas delivering some critical care interventions were present in all three countries, and these were of similar size and nurse staffing ratios. The total potential per capita capacity for delivering at least some critical care to postoperative patients increases after these enhance care areas are taken into account.

### Strengths and weaknesses

Our survey had nearly complete coverage of all UK and NZ public secondary care organisations that provide inpatient surgical care. The data collected is therefore likely to be an accurate representation of available postoperative facilities in both countries. 

While NHS England collects data on critical care bed numbers, these are aggregated at Trust level, and not individual hospital site-level. The Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG) publishes an annual audit report of critical care outcomes and facilities, against which we cross-checked our results, and found high levels of agreement.[@scottish_intensive_care_society_audit_group_audit_2017] To our knowledge the national health authorities in Wales and Northern Ireland do not compile publicly accessible data of this nature for secondary analysis. The Australian New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) publishes an annual report with information on the total number of adult intensive care units across Australia and NZ, which includes numbers of paediatric intensive care beds in their counts.[@noauthor_anzics_2017] Our data are therefore comprehensive and robust, and contain information not routinely collected by national bodies in all three countries. A further key strength of this study is that we have been able to provide the first empirical description of perioperative high-acuity care areas.

There are however also some weaknesses to this work. First, the response rate in Australia was lower than in the UK and NZ. A *post hoc* sensitivity analysis conducted showed that the Australian hospitals sampled in our study was weighted towards medium-to-large major hospitals which provide postgraduate anaesthesia specialty training, and capable of delivering higher numbers of specialist services (Supplementary Material). Second, a higher proportion of NZ hospitals that responded were tertiary institutions. Larger tertiary institutions in Australia and NZ may have had increased motivation to participate in our study, and survey dissemination via local networks may have favoured tertiary hospitals due to the nature of the networks used (the anaesthesia trainee research networks relied upon to distribute the survey are more likely to be found within larger tertiary hospitals). Third, private sector hospitals were also not approached in our survey, and we therefore were not able to explore the pathways in those institutions, which we acknowledge may provide a substantial proportion of elective surgical care, especially in Australia, where the spend on private healthcare as a proportion of total healthcare expenditure is higher compared to UK and NZ (UK: 21.9%, Australia: 31.9%, and NZ: 21.1% of healthcare spend).[@organisation_for_economic_co-operation_and_development_oecd_health_2018] These differences in our sample must be considered when considering the comparative data we present about the three countries. Finally, due to the difference in population distributions in Australia and NZ, these nations have a large number of geographically dispersed small rural hospitals, usually without critical care provision, and linked to central hubs of secondary/tertiary care; these differences from the UK make direct comparisons of health systems difficult.

### Defining critical care

Historically, critical care bed capacity per capita in the UK, Australia and NZ has been found to be low compared to many other developed health systems.[@adhikari_critical_2010; @rhodes_variability_2012] However, research in this area is made difficult by the lack of international consensus in critical care definitions. In the UK, Guidelines for the Provision of Intensive Care Services (GPICS) were recently published by the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and Intensive Care Society in 2015,[@masterson_guidelines_2015] following on from earlier publications which aimed to describe ICU/HDU standards in the UK.[@intensive_care_society_levels_2009; @noauthor_core_2013] In Australia and NZ, the College of Intensive Care Medicine (CICM) defines minimum standards for ICU and HDU in separate documents.[@noauthor_minimum_2011; @noauthor_guidelines_2013]

A Level 0-3 classification system has been adopted in the UK, and it is referred to extensively in GPICS. Level 3 indicates care for complex patients requiring support for multi-organ failure and with a minimum of 1:1 nurse:patient ratio, while Level 2 indicates care for patients with single organ support and a minimum 1:2 nurse:patient ratio. In contrast to the UK, Level I, II and III ICU definitions in Australia and NZ, refer not to patient dependency but instead to multiple organisational factors relating to work practice/caseload, staffing requirements, operational requirements, design, and monitoring and equipment standards.[@noauthor_minimum_2011] In Australia and NZ, Level III ICUs are tertiary referral units for intensive care patients, while Level I and II ICUs are rural units serving smaller popoulations where there are limited specialist services available, and where travel to specialist services may cause delay.[@noauthor_minimum_2011] Therefore Level I-III ICUs in Australia and NZ are all able to provide a period of mechanical ventilation, and HDUs do not come under this classification system.[@noauthor_guidelines_2013]

### Other less clearly defined "high-acuity care" areas - Level 1.5 units?

Beyond the definitions above, there are other patient care areas within the hospital, which do not traditionally fall under the widely accepted umbrella of ICU/HDU critical care units. These other areas have the ability to care for patients who require one or more interventions associated with critical care. For example, within the Emergency Department, resuscitation bays have the facilities to temporarily care for critically ill patients requiring intensive nursing/medical interventions. Another example would be the cardiologists' Coronary Care Unit, which may have the ability to deliver 1:1 or 1:2 nursing, invasive blood pressure monitoring, continuous ECG telemetry and inotropic/vasopressor support.

We sought to identify high-acuity care areas capable of delivering higher levels of postoperative care compared to usual ward level care. We suggest that these high-acuity beds have evolved in the UK, Australia and NZ to compensate for the low critical care capacity for high-risk patients. These areas may be thought of as "Level 1.5" units, to borrow from the traditional UK classification system described above. Our survey has demonstrated that many hospitals may use such facilities to deliver postoperative critical care to patients.

### Our results in relation to existing literature

Using administrative panel data from multiple different sources, Adhikari *et al* estimated the per capita ratio of critical care beds in a number of countries, and further estimated the number of ICU beds per 100 hospital beds.[@adhikari_critical_2010] They reported 1.2 ICU beds per 100 hospital beds for the UK, and 1.5 ICU beds per 100 hospital beds for NZ public hospitals, but did not provide estimates for Australia. They also further estimated per capita ICU bed ratios of 3.5, 5.6 and 4.7 per 100,000 population for UK, Australia and NZ respectively. In a separate study of European critical care capacity, Rhodes *et al* estimated 2.8 ICU beds per 100 hospital beds and 6.6 ICU/intermediate care beds per 100,000 population for the UK in 2012.[@rhodes_variability_2012]

The ANZICS Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation reported 9.0 ICU beds per 100,000 population in Australia and 5.3 ICU beds per 100,000 population in NZ.[@noauthor_anzics_2017] These numbers are similar to our estimates for ventilated critical care beds per 100,000 population for each country.

While the critical care capacity estimates from our study differ from these previous estimates, our findings seem to support the previous suggestions that Australia and NZ critical care bed ratios are generally higher than the UK. We propose that differences in our estimates may be due to: 1) variable definitions used for critical care; 2) differences in sampling methodology; 3) changes in total hospital bed numbers and critical care bed numbers in each country over time.

In our study, we asked respondents to provide the numbers of critical care beds in their hospitals, including both ICU and HDU beds in the query. We used local collaborator-reported bed numbers for both the numerator and the denominator to arrive at our calculated ratios. In contrast, Adhikari *et al* obtained estimates based on literature review, synthesising data from a number of different sources. Their primary sources were a 2005 paper published by Wunsch *et al* obtained from administrative datasets for the UK,[@wunsch_variation_2008] and a 2006/2007 report by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS).[@drennan_intensive_2008; @martin_unique_2010] Rhodes *et al* estimated critical care bed numbers using aggregated country-level data dating from 2010, combining data from a number of different administrative sources&mdash;including the European Commission database (Eurostat), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) World Factbook and the OECD. Our results therefore add a reliable, updated and empirical primary data source to the literature.

Using intermediate definitions for surgery, approximately 8,000 inpatient surgical procedures were performed per 100,000 population per year in the UK **NHS** between 2009 and 2014, with an estimated `r formatC((1-0.528)*8073, big.mark = ",")` per 100,000 per year requiring overnight stay.[@abbott_frequency_2017] In comparison, `r formatC(1127574/24600000 * 100000, big.mark = ",")` an estimated surgical admissions per 100,000 population per year occur in Australian public hospitals,[@australian_institute_of_health_and_welfare_admitted_2018] and 4,669 surgical procedures per 100,000 population per year are performed in New Zealand.[@rose_estimated_2015; @weiser_estimate_2015] Therefore, combining the results from our study with the other data obtained from the literature, the availability of critical care beds in relation to volume of surgical activity performed in public hospitals can be approximated for each country (UK = `r per_capita_ccu$ccuPerCapita[1]/((1-0.528)*8073)*1000`, Australia = `r per_capita_ccu$ccuPerCapita[2]/4584*1000`, New Zealand = `r per_capita_ccu$ccuPerCapita[3]/4669*1000` critical care beds per 1,000 surgical procedures). However, these estimates are may be limited by differences in the definitions used when accounting for surgical volume between the different statistical sources.

### Unanswered questions and future research

What is clear from our study is the prevalence of high-acuity beds in many of hospitals throughout the three countries studied. We propose that these high-acuity beds are being used to augment the critical care capacity in hospitals where ICU/HDU beds may be insufficient to support clinical activity. However, we are unable to comment on patient case-mix within these areas, or on the clinical effectiveness of treatment in these units. The high-acuity care areas likely represent a heterogenous group of bed types and further research is required to describe the detail of the structures and processes within these units, and the outcomes of patients admitted to them. We do not currently know if they provide good value care and whether they are a sufficient alternative to traditional ICU/HDU care for high risk patients. Rapid expansion in their numbers cannot currently be recommended without further evaluation.

Other important factors which might influence the capacity to deliver postoperative care to high-risk patients may also need further exploration. Particularly, the effects of hospital networking arrangements across large geographical regions was not explored in our study. Inter-hospital transfer is an established mechanism for diverting patients when critical care capacity may be inadequate in the transferring hospital, or when centralised tertiary services only available in the receiving hospital are required.[@whiteley_guidelines_2011] There is evidence that patients transferred for non-clinical indications may have longer lengths of stay, but equivalent mortality outcomes, and therefore critical care capacities across regions may be important in resource planning beyond the immediate needs of a single hospital.[@barratt_effect_2012] 

### Conclusion

There are differences between the UK, Australia and NZ in postoperative provision of care, both in terms of critical care capacity, and also staffing levels in general surgical wards. There are no significant differences in critical care bed numbers as a proportion of total beds at each hospital between the three countries, after adjusting for hospital size and tertiary care provision. We identify and describe high-acuity care areas which accommodate high-risk surgical patients for postoperative management. Per capita postoperative critical care availability was lowest in the UK after accounting for these high-acuity care beds. We suggest that high-acuity care areas may have developed organically to facilitate the provision of some aspects of critical care &mdash; in particular more favourable nurse:patient ratios &mdash; outside the ICU and HDU, in order to meet service demand. However, the utility of these high-acuity beds requires further evaluation.

### Sensitivity Analysis for Australian Hospitals

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sensitivity_table_1 <- readRDS("data/sensitivity_table_1.rds")
colnames(sensitivity_table_1) <- c("National", "Survey Respondents")

pander(sensitivity_table_1, "Supplementary Table 1: Characteristics of hospitals sampled within this study compared to overall characteristics of all hospitals in Australia.")
```

An analysis was performed to examine the extent to which our sample of Australian hospitals was subject to bias. Openly-published data of hospitals offering surgical services from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare were obtained which included data on the number of specialist services offered at the hospital, and a classification of hospital type.[@australian_institute_of_health_and_welfare_myhospitals_2017] Children's hospitals, small rural hospitals, and hospitals not offering surgery were excluded from this open dataset as they were not considered comparable to hospitals in the UK. The characteristics (state regions, hospital groups and numbers of specialist services offered) of the hospitals in our study sample was compared against the characteristics for all hospitals in Australia.

The distribution of hospital types, regions and the number of specialist services offered within sites responding to our survey was examined and compared with the overall distribution of the same factors in all hospitals in Australia. Our study sampled 17 hospitals which were classed as "Major Hospitals" (51.52%), although this category comprised 21.99% of all hospitals in Australia. The median number of specialist services offered by hospitals in our study sample was also higher than the overall median for hospitals in Australia.

Therefore when interpreting the results of our study, the reader needs to consider that our Australian data sample is weighted towards medium-to-large hospitals offering more specialist services.

### UK definitions of critical care

The Level 0-3 classification system has been adopted by the majority of UK NHS institutions for Critical Care, and it is referred to extensively in GPICS.[@masterson_guidelines_2015; @intensive_care_society_levels_2009; @noauthor_core_2013] It is shown below:

>| Levels        | Description   | 
>| :-----------: |:--------------|
>| 0             | Patients whose needs can be met through normal ward care in an acute hospital. |
>| 1             | Patients at risk of their condition deteriorating, or those recently relocated from higher levels of care, whose needs can be met on an acute ward with additional advice and support from the Critical Care team. |
>| 2             | Patients requiring more detailed observation or intervention including support for a single failing organ system or post-operative care and those ‘stepping down’ from higher levels of care. |
>| 3             | Patients requiring advanced respiratory support alone, or basic respiratory support together with support of at least two organ systems. This level includes all complex patients requiring support for multi-organ failure. |

The Level 0-3 classification system describes the patients' needs first, then matches the levels of intervention/observation required in order to adequately care for the patient. It has widespread acceptance, for example, the Care Quality Commission also adopts this classification system in its inspection framework for NHS Acute Hospitals[@noauthor_inspection_2015]. 

### Australian and New Zealand definitions of critical care

The Level I-III ANZICS classification system in Australia and New Zealand only refer to Intensive Care Units, and does not include HDUs which are separately defined.[@noauthor_minimum_2011; @noauthor_guidelines_2013] A summary of the ANZICS classification system is shown below:

>| Levels        | Description   | 
>| :-----------: |:--------------|
>| I             | A unit capable of providing immediate resuscitation and short term cardio-respiratory support for critically ill patients, and able to provide mechanical ventilation and simple invasive cardiovascular monitoring for a period of at least several hours. No minimum number of beds, but capacity based on demand. |
>| II            | A unit capable of providing mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and invasive cardiovascular monitoring for an indefinite period. At least 6 staffed and equipped beds with more than 200 mechanically ventilated patients admitted per annum. |
>| III           | A tertiary referral unit for intensive care patients capable of providing comprehensive critical care including complex multi-system life support for an indefinite period. Level III units should have a demonstrated commitment to academic education and research. All patients admitted to the unit must be referred for management to the attending intensive care specialist. At least 8 staffed and equipped beds to discharge commitments consistent with a tertiary referral centre, divided into smaller areas of 8-15 beds. Normally more than 400 mechanically ventilated patients admitted per annum. Medical director with full-time commitment to ICU and who is a Fellow of the College of Intensive Care Medicine. Minimum standards for support staff, such as clerical and secretarial staff and equipment officers and other allied health professionals. |
